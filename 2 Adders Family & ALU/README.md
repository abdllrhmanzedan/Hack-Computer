# Adders Family & ALU
This project focuses on the implementation of adders and the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), which are fundamental components for the Hack-Computer.

## What Does It Offer?
- **Adders**: 
  - **Half-Adder**: Performs the addition of two binary bits and outputs a sum and carry.
  - **Full-Adder**: Expands on the half-adder by handling the carry input from previous bit additions, enabling the addition of multi-bit binary numbers.
- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**: 
  - The ALU performs arithmetic and logical operations e.g. addition, subtraction, and bitwise operations. 
  - It uses the adders to perform arithmetic tasks and includes control inputs to select the operation to be executed. 
  - In the Hack-Computer, the ALU is part of the CPU to execute machine-level instructions and calculations.
