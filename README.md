# Hack-Computer: Nand2Tetris Project
<!-- Summary -->

## A Pilot Overview: Key Highlights of the Project
<!-- explaining the each part in simple way -->

## Progress Overview
Here’s what I’ve Done so far in the project (in-time progress):

### From Nand to Hack: Hack-Computer Hardware & Architecture
1 - [x] **Elementary Logic Gates**: Designed basic gates like And, Or, Not, Mux, DMux, and more using HDL.
2 - [x] **Adders Family and ALU**: Implemented the adder circuits and the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), responsible for performing both arithmetic and logic operations with efficiency and precision.
3 - [ ] **Memory Units**: Built registers and RAM, key components for data storage and manipulation.
4 - [ ] **Machine Language**: Learned and implemented programs using the Hack machine language.
5 - [ ] **CPU and Architecture**: Combined all components to build a functional CPU and computer architecture.
