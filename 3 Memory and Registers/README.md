# Memory and Registers
This project introduces sequential circuits and the flip-flops, which are essential for building memory components.
It explains how bits can be stored, manipulated and expanded to registers, giving the ability for creating memory `(RAM and ROM)`.

## Memory in Hack-Computer

In the Hack Computer, memory is built from flip-flops, which store individual bits (0 or 1). These bits are combined in registers to store larger amounts of data. The memory system in the Hack Computer is divided into: 
- **RAM:** for general-purpose data storage.
- **ROM:** for storing program instructions.
This project shows how the make this memory units.

## What Does It Offer?
- **Store Data:** Using registers, data can be stored in memory.
- **Operate on Stored Data:** arithmetic or logical operations can be performed on the stored data.
- **Writing new Data:** memory allows data to be updated.
