/*
4-way 16-bit multiplexor:
4Ã—1 mux and having 2bit selector. The truth table divides it into to equla halves
so we select the candidate one from each half

sel | out
00  | a
01  | b
---------
10  | c
11  | d

from first half we pick based on sel[0]=0, branch1 = a, else branch1 = b
from second half we pick based on sel[1]=0, branch2=c, else branch2 = d
then after having the result for each half, we pick whic half to go with based on sel[1]


out = a if sel = 00
      b if sel = 01
      c if sel = 10
      d if sel = 11
