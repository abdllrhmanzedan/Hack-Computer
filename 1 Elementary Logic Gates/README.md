# Elementary Logic gates
This project begins by constructing the fundamental logic gates that are the building blocks for all other complex chips of the whole journey.
Starting only `Nand` gate, we develop the necessary components.

## What Chips Do We Need?
Using only the `Nand` gate as a base, we can construct all the essential logic gates needed to build more complex circuits. These include:
- **And**
- **Or**
- **Not**
- **Mux (Multiplexer)**
- **DMux (Demultiplexer)**
Additionally, providing multi-way and multi-bit versions of these gates.
